C implementation of some data structures 2008 - 2015


This is some data structures, I started this project back in 2008 as a  school project.

src : working data structures (Linked list and stack)
staging : partially implemented data structures
test : test routines for src

`build.sh` can be used to build  a static library nammed libGDS (Generic Data Structures library) and test binaries that uses the libGDS (test_linked_list and test_stack)
