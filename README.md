C implementation of some data structures 2008 - 2015


This is some data structures, I started this project back in 2008 for a
school project, the data structure are not expecially fast or optimised
but the implematation is clean and there should not be any issu using this
library. 

src : working data structures (Linked list and stack)
staging : every partially implemented data structures
test : test routines for src

build.sh build the programme as a static library and the test routines in test
